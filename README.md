###Panic Button
* Active item, single use
* On activation, the game moves at SPEED! challenge pace for the next 10 rooms.
* The item is consumed and a countdown appears above Isaac's head, showing
        how many rooms are left to clear.
* Individual boss rush & greed mode waves count as 1 room each.
* Big rooms do not count as 2 rooms.
* When the countdown reaches 0, game speed returns to normal and the button
        spawns an item and several pickups.
* Spawns 2 items if completed on a post-Mom floor.

###TODO:
* add to item pools (API doesn't facilitate this yet)
* speed up music if active (is this possible?)
* "animate" the required room count as it approaches zero
* add weights to more valuable pickups
* tweak spawn numbers
* speed up player (like post-nerf SPEED! challenge)?
* spawn items from specific item pools based on floor (like Pandora's Box)?
* switch to costume instead RenderText above the player's head?
