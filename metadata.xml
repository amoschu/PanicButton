[h1]Panic Button[/h1]
[list]
[*] Active item, single use
[*] On activation, the game moves at SPEED! challenge pace for the next 10 rooms.
[*] The item is consumed and a countdown appears above Isaac's head, showing
        how many rooms are left to clear.
[*] Individual boss rush and greed mode waves count as 1 room each.
[*] Big rooms do not count as 2 rooms.
[*] When the countdown reaches 0, game speed returns to normal and the button
        spawns an item and several pickups.
[*] Spawns 2 items if completed on a post-Mom floor.
[/list]

[h1]How to get the item[/h1]
Play the game!

Or if you really, really want to try it out:
[olist]
[*] [url=https://zatherz.eu/isaac/afterbirth+docs/md__i_1_doxygen_test_input_converted_test__debug__console__primer.html]Open the console[/url]
[*] Type [code]giveitem Panic Button[/code] and hit enter (note: this will completely replace your current active item)
[/olist]

[h1]TODO:[/h1]
[list]
[*] implement boss rush and greed mode waves
[*] stop drawing the countdown during cutscenes
[*] speed up music if active (is this possible?)
[*] &quot;animate&quot; the required room count as it approaches zero
[*] tweak reward pickup weights
[*] ? speed up player (like post-nerf SPEED! challenge)?
[*] ? spawn items from specific item pools based on floor (like Pandora's Box)?
[*] ? switch to costume instead of RenderText above the player's head?
